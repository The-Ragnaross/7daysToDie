        <p>Obviously the player and the things that pertain to them, many outside forces affect the gameplay.</p>
        <h3>Enemies</h3>
        <p>Starting with what is perhaps the biggest impact on the game, the enemies. There are many different kinds of enemies, the most obvious being the zombies, however there are plenty of other things that may pose a threat to you. There are also zombies of different strengths.</p>
        <img src="styles/Business.jpg">
        <p>Here we have the businessman zombie, one of the most common types of zombies you will see, a very average threat to you, nothing special.</p>
        <img src="styles/mutate.jpg">
        <p>This is a mutated zombies, it can take more hits than your average zombie, but also, if you don't kill it quick enough it qill spew out radioactive sludge. If you see this zombie, it may be a good idea to make use of a ranged weapon.</p>
        <img src="styles/bear.jpg">
        <p>As already stated, zombies are not the only enemy in the game, wild life can also pose a serious threat sometimes. For instance, here we have a bear. Bears are a good source of meat and animal fat, but also a forminable foe, stronger than a large portion of the zombies you will encounter.</p>
        <h3>Traders</h3>
        <p>You aren't alone in this world! There are a number of traders ready to help you as long as you're willing to help them. Functionally they are all the same, but those functions are many.</p>
        <img src="styles/dukes.jpg">
        <p>Duke's Casino Tokens are the currency in this post apocalyptic world. They are used to buy things from the traders. You can find them by looting various containers and selling things, but can also be earned from the trader by doing quests for them. There are multiple different types of quests which can range from clearing zombies out of a certain area, or restoring electricity to a place that needs it.</p>
        <h3>The Blood Moon</h3>
        <img src="styles/bloodMoon.jpg">
        <p>Every 7 days the zombies get much stronger and actively seek out players. Most of the time, night time is no serious threat other than lower visibility, but on the blood moon the player had best be prepared. Build a bunker, stock up on ammunition and meds, cross your fingers. It will continue to get harder as you get stronger, so be ready, and good luck.</p>
