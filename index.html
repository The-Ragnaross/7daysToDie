                <p>Welcome to 7 Days to Die, the survival horde crafting game. Zombies lurke everywhere you may look, but at night they seem to become stronger, and on the 7th night, you'd better be prepared for the worst. In this game you will be taken on adventures through wastelands, vast cities, frozen tundras and more. You'll go on quests to fetch supplies, kill zombies, and restore power. This site will be your guide to help you succeed in game, it will provide info about you as the player, your armor, weapons, and possible strategies to use, as well as info about the world you'll be living in. Will you play alone and tackle the challenge yourself or will you invite friends to cooperate with. Will you become a great engineer or will you excell in combat. In short, will you survive 7 days, or will the blood moon claim your life?</p>
